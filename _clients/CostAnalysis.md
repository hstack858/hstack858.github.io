## Purpose

This fall I decided to make my first android app because my roommates started sharing a lot of our food. We needed a way to determine how much each person owed every month, so I made this cost analysis tool to give someone a price owed based on the percentage of each product they used.

## Technical Details

This project was made using Flutter and can be run on an Android Studio VM.
